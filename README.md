# Git Bash & GitHub Hands-On Project: System Monitor Dashboard



## 1. Introduction
This project is a real-time System Monitor Dashboard built using HTML, CSS (Tailwind), JavaScript, and Node.js. It visualizes CPU, RAM, Disk, and Network usage using a cyberpunk "Nebula" theme. It is containerized using Docker.



## 2. Project Instructions & Commands Used
This repository demonstrates version control mastery.
- **Initialization:** `git init`
- **Commits:** `git commit -m "message"`
- **Branching:** `git checkout -b <branch_name>`
- **Merging:** `git merge <branch_name>`
- **Remote:** `git push -u origin master`



## 3. Branches Created
1. **master:** Stable production code.
2. **feature:** Added new dashboard titles and todo lists.
3. **bugfix:** Corrected server comments.
4. **test:** Added test logs.
5. **experiment:** Used to demonstrate merge conflicts.




## 4. Challenges & Conclusion
**Challenge:** Encountered a merge conflict in `README.md` when two branches modified the project status line simultaneously.
**Solution:** Manually edited the file to remove conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) and combined the text to reflect both statuses.



**Conclusion:** This project successfully demonstrates the full Git workflow from local development to remote synchronization.
